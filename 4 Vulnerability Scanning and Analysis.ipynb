    "1. Install OpenVAS if needed.  You will need to install it with Kali.  Parrot includes it already by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run 'openvas-setup' as root. This will download the latest rule sets, create an admin user, and start up the various requisite services. Given that this is a VM, it will probably take some time, so plan accordingly.\n",

    "3. Change the admin password to something more useful by running the command 'openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=somethinguseful' as root.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Run 'openvas-start' as root and then open the web interface using the URL provided from the command output."
